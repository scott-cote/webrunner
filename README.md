# webrunner
WebRunner is an extensible proxy server designed to make debugging, testing, and code exploration easier for full stack web developers. As a proxy, it is given HTTP traffic intended for another server and can manipulate the requests and responses as needed. WebRunnerâ€™s default behavior is to pass all traffic between the client and origin server with as little change as possible. A user controlled configuration file is used to specify a collection of plugins that are used to manipulate or log the traffic in any way that is helpful for debugging or testing. WebRunner comes with a set of stock Javascript plugins and users can create their own for specific use cases.
